# Level 3 - Testing the Merkle Proof Verification

Welcome to Level 3 of your Smart Contract Development journey! In this level, you'll put your Merkle proof verification function to the test. Your task is to implement a test case in the TestMerkleProof contract that verifies the 3rd leaf node using the provided proof, root, leaf, and index. Ready to ensure the correctness of your Merkle proof verification function? Let's dive in!

## Objective

Your objective in Level 3 is to test the Merkle proof verification function using the TestMerkleProof contract. By implementing a test case that verifies the 3rd leaf node, you'll ensure that your verification function returns `true` for this specific scenario.

## Task

Your task in Level 3 is to implement a test case in the TestMerkleProof contract that verifies the 3rd leaf node using the provided proof, root, leaf, and index. Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:

- **Test Case Implementation**: Write a test case in the TestMerkleProof contract that verifies the 3rd leaf node using the provided proof, root, leaf, and index.
- **Verification Function Call**: Call the `verify` function with the provided proof, root, leaf, and index parameters.
- **Expected Outcome**: Ensure that the verification function returns `true` for this test case.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Objective

- Review the objective of Level 3 to understand the task at hand. Your goal is to implement a test case that verifies the 3rd leaf node using the provided proof, root, leaf, and index.

### Step 2: Implement the Test Case

- Navigate to the TestMerkleProof contract and write a test case that verifies the 3rd leaf node using the provided proof, root, leaf, and index.
- Call the `verify` function with the provided parameters and ensure that it returns `true` for this test case.

### Step 3: Verify the Outcome

- After implementing the test case, deploy the TestMerkleProof contract and verify that the verification function returns `true` for the 3rd leaf node.

## Final Thoughts

Testing is a crucial aspect of smart contract development. By implementing a test case for the Merkle proof verification function, you'll ensure that it behaves as expected under different scenarios. After completing Level 3, you'll have confidence in the correctness and effectiveness of your Merkle proof verification implementation.
